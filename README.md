## About

A Fortune Teller Quiz
Similar to the project above, include a series of questions that instruct users to "Check all that apply".
Then, based on how many answers the users selected in each of several 'categories', provide them customized results.
For instance, you could prompt users to select each of the stereotypically "unlucky" events that have occurred to them in the last month ("Seeing a black cat", "Walking under a ladder", "Stubbing your toe", etc.), then how many "lucky" events have occurred ("Finding a four-leaf clover", "Seeing a rainbow", etc.) Then, based on this, provide them a silly fortune.
Include at least 3 possible results.
